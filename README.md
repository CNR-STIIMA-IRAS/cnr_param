# cnr_param

A package to read and write parameters for your C++ application.

## Getting Started
The basic way to load parameters is using this command from terminal

```
Get help typing
```

By default, the parameters are saved in '/tmp/cnr_param'. You can choose another folder by setting in the 'bashrc' file
